difference between document and window object

Well, the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight,
 nam
 


What about the document object then? The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. 
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. 
What does this really mean? That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property
 which is also available in short as document.property.
